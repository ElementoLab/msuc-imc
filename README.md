Imaging mass cytometry data is available from the following Zenodo repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6251221

## Reproducibility

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+ (running on 3.8.2)
- Python packages as specified in the [requirements file](requirements.txt) - install with `make requirements` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Download data

Please download files available in the Zenodo repository and place them in a folder named `processed/20200122_PD_L1_100_percent_case/tiffs` from the root of the project (e.g. if cloning the repository).

### Running

Essentially all analysis is [in one file](src/case.PM2078.analysis.py), which can be run for example like:
```
python src/case.PM2078.analysis.py
```

Additional steps that were used to process the raw data from a MCD file can be seen in the [Makefile](Makefile).

This is roughly equivalent to running `imc process ${TIFF_FILES}`.
